# Harold.js
A guild "Harold" For world of Warcraft guilds

Hi This project is archived. I no longer play World of Warcraft. I'd happily pass this off to anyone interested in maintaining. The core purpose of the bot no long seems valid (Checking legendaries/weapon power) to prevent people from faking their Ilvl with crafted garabge.


# Usage
Clone and run `nodejs bot.js` 

Setup YOUR token and client ID from discord API
https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro

# In Discord Usage
All commands are prefixed with prefix in config.json. Default is `Harold,`

This bot will help you evaluate players via World of Warcraft API inside of Discord
